# Background
- Before starting any computer science classes, I wanted to experience how to code in Python and the capabilities of the language. While following along a YouTube tutorial, I got to learn many aspects of Python and how to use them to create a simple interactive game like TicTacToe.
- This repository features a classic Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in Python, demonstrating the use of fundamental programming concepts such as functions for game logic, board display, and win condition checks. Key functions include display_board() for rendering the game board, player_input() for handling player moves, and check_win() for determining game outcomes. The project showcases skills in Python's control structures, data handling, and user interaction.

# How to Play
1. **Create a New File within your desired IDE:** Copy the game code into your new Python file.
2. **Ensure all necessary functions are in the Python script:** printBoard, playerInput, checkHorizontal, checkRow, checkDiagonal, checkTie, checkWin, switchPlayer, and computer.
3. **Simply run the code:** You will be greeted with a prompt in your terminal to enter a position number to mark your first position. The position numbers are as follows:
```
1 | 2 | 3
----------
4 | 5 | 6
----------
7 | 8 | 9
```
4. **Rerun the code:** If you have reached the end and would like to play again against the computer, simply rerun the code.
